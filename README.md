# C++ Thread Pool – Concurrency Study

This repository contains a study and analysis of a widely used open-source
C++ thread pool implementation.



## Concepts Covered
- Thread pools and thread reuse
- Producer–consumer task queue
- Synchronization using mutex and condition_variable
- Asynchronous task execution with futures
- Graceful shutdown of worker threads

## Learning Outcome
- Understood how worker threads wait efficiently using condition variables
- Learned how thread reuse reduces overhead
- Explored OS-level scheduling behavior on Linux

## Disclaimer
This project is used strictly for learning and understanding C++ concurrency concepts.
